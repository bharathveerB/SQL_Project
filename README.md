# Target E-commerce Analytics (SQL)

## üéØ Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive **SQL data analysis** of a large Brazilian e-commerce dataset, designed to extract actionable business intelligence for a retail giant like **Target**. The primary objective was to move beyond basic reporting to answer strategic questions related to **growth trends, logistics performance, economic impact, and customer behavior**.

The analysis focuses on several key performance indicators (KPIs) to provide data-driven recommendations that can inform marketing, logistics, and pricing strategies in the Brazilian market.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Tools

* **Database Language:** SQL (Specifically formulated for **Google BigQuery** syntax, as seen in the uploaded queries, but easily adaptable to PostgreSQL/MySQL).
* **Data Source:** 8 distinct CSV files representing various facets of e-commerce operations.
* **Analysis Artifact:** `SQL_TARGET_QUERY.sql` (Contains all the complex queries used for analysis).
* **Visualization (Planned):** Tableau, Power BI, or Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn) for visualizing final results.

## üóÑÔ∏è 8 Core Datasets & Schema

The analysis relies on **8 relational tables** that detail the entire e-commerce flow, from product listing to customer review. These tables were loaded from the provided CSV files into a SQL database for querying.
